## McAfee-Decryptor
McAfee site list decryptor

Tool allows for the decryption of the password contained within the SiteList.xml. This project came about due to the original tool not working on my system. Decided to re-write it in Perl.

###Dependencies
Tested on Devuan and Parrot OS

	$ sudo apt install libltdl-dev libmcrypt-dev cpanminus libdigest-sha-perl
	$ sudo cpanm Mcrypt
